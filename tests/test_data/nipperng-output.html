<hr><h2>2. <a name="SecurityAudit">Security Audit</a></h2>
<h3>2.1. <a name="sec_Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
Nipper performed a security audit of the Cisco Router retail on Saturday 6th February 2021. This section details the findings of the security audit together with the impact and recommendations.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.2. <a name="sec_SoftwareVersion">Software Version</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> It is critically important that software be regularly maintained with patches and upgrades in order to help mitigate the risk of an attacker exploiting a known software vulnerability. Furthermore, additional security features and other functionality are normally added or extended with each software revision.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that the Cisco Router retail was running the out of date software Internet Operating System (IOS) version 12.3. Some of the known vulnerabilities for this software version are listed in Table 2.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<table class="table">
 <caption>Table 2: Potential software vulnerabilities</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Description</th>
   <th>CVE Reference</th>
   <th>Bugtraq ID</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
 <tbody>
<tr><td>Telnet remote denial of service</td><td>CVE-2004-1464</td><td>11060</td></tr>
<tr><td>IPv4 TCP listener denial of service</td><td>CVE-2007-0479</td><td>22208</td></tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;<br>

It is worth noting that Nipper used the version number detailed in the device configuration to identify the potential vulnerabilities, and patches may have already been applied. Additionally, a specific device configuration may be required in order for the device to become vulnerable.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> The vulnerabilities listed in Table 2 could allow an attacker to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Exploit code is widely available on the Internet for known Cisco Router vulnerabilities.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper strongly recommends that the software be updated and patched to the latest software version. Furthermore, Nipper recommends that the current patch policy be reviewed.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.3. <a name="sec_InboundTCPConnectionKeepAlives">Inbound TCP Connection Keep Alives</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Connections to a Cisco Router device could become orphaned if a connection becomes disrupted. An attacker could attempt a DoS attack against a Cisco Router by exhausting the number of possible connections. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) keep alive messages can be configured to confirm that a remote connection is valid and then terminate any orphaned connections.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that TCP keep alive messages are not sent for connections from remote hosts.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker could attempt a DoS by exhausting the number of possible connections.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Tools are available on the Internet that can open large numbers of TCP connections without correctly terminating them.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that TCP keep alive messages be sent to detect and drop orphaned connections from remote systems. TCP keep alive messages can be enabled for connections from remote systems using the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">service tcp-keepalives-in</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.4. <a name="sec_ConnectionTimeout">Connection Timeout</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Connection timeouts can be configured for a number of the device services. If a timeout were configured on an administrative service, an administrator that did not correctly terminate the connection would have it automatically closed after the timeout expires. However, if a timeout is not configured, or is configured to be a long timeout, an unauthorised user may be able to gain access using the administrator's previously logged-in connection.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper identified three connection settings that were not configured to timeout within ten minutes, these are listed in Table 3.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<table class="table">
 <caption>Table 3: Connections with inadequate timeout periods</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Connection</th>
   <th>Timeout</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
 <tbody>
<tr><td>Console line 0</td><td>No Timeout</td></tr>
<tr><td>Auxiliary line 0</td><td>No Timeout</td></tr>
<tr><td>VTY lines 0 to 4</td><td>No Timeout</td></tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;<br>

<b>Impact:</b> An attacker who was able to gain access to a connection that had not expired, would be able to continue using that connection. A connection could be a console port on the device that was not correctly terminated or a remote administrative connection.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> The attacker would have to gain physical access to the device to use the console port, or gain remote access to an administration machine that is attached to the port. To gain access to remote connections, an attacker would have to be able to intercept network traffic between the client and retail. The attacker would then have to take over the connection, which could be very difficult with some services. Tools are available on the Internet that would facilitate the monitoring of network connections.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that a timeout period of ten minutes be configured for connections to the device retail.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.5. <a name="sec_AuxiliaryPort">Auxiliary Port</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> The auxiliary port's primary purpose is to provide a remote administration capability. It can allow a remote administrator to use a modem to dial into the Cisco device.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that the auxiliary port on the Cisco device retail allowed exec connections and did not appear to have the callback feature configured.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker may discover the modem number for the device during a war-dial. If an attacker were able to connect to the device remotely, then they may be able to brute-force the login to gain access to the device.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> The attacker would have to first identify the telephone number of the device, probably through a war-dial. A modem attached to a telephone line would have to be attached directly to the Cisco device's auxiliary port. Then the attacker would be able to attach to the device in order to perform a brute-force of the login.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that, if not required, the auxiliary port exec be disabled. Exec can be disabled on the aux port with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no exec</div>&nbsp;<br>
If the auxiliary port is required for remote administration, the callback feature can be configured to dial a specific preconfigured telephone number.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.6. <a name="sec_IPSourceRouting">IP Source Routing</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> IP source routing is a feature whereby a network packet can specify how it should be routed through the network. Cisco routers normally accept and process source routes specified by a packet, unless the feature has been disabled.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that IP source routing was not disabled.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> IP source routing can allow an attacker to specify a route for a network packet to follow, possibly to bypass a Firewall device or an Intruder Detection System (IDS). An attacker could also use source routing to capture network traffic by routing it through a system controlled by the attacker.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> An attacker would have to control either a routing device or an end point device in order to modify a packets route through the network. However, tools are available on the Internet that would allow an attacker to specify source routes. Tools are also available to modify network routing using vulnerabilities in some routing protocols.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that, if not required, IP source routing be disabled. IP source routing can be disabled by issuing the following IOS command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no ip source routing</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.7. <a name="sec_HyperTextTransportProtocolService">HyperText Transport Protocol Service</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Recent Cisco IOS-based devices support web-based administration using the HTTP protocol. Cisco web-based administration facilities can sometimes be basic but they do provide a simple method of administering remote devices. However, HTTP is a clear-text protocol and is vulnerable to various packet-capture techniques.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The HTTP service was configured and made use of an access-list to restrict access to the device.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker who was able to monitor network traffic could capture authentication credentials. This issue is made more serious with the enable password being used for authentication as this would give the attacker full administrative access to the device with the captured credentials. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Network packet and password sniffing tools are widely available on the Internet. Once authentication credentials have been captured it is trivial to use the credentials to log in using the captured credentials. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that, if not required, the HTTP service be disabled. If a remote method of access to the device is required, consider using HTTPS or Secure Shell (SSH). The encrypted HTTPS and SSH services may require a firmware or hardware upgrade. The HTTP service can be disabled with the following IOS command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no ip http server</div>&nbsp;<br>
If it is not possible to upgrade the device to use the encrypted HTTPS or SSH services, additional security can be configured. The authentication method can be changed using the following command (where the authentication method is either local, enable, tacacs or aaa):<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">ip http authentication [<i>authentication method</i>]</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.8. <a name="sec_Telnet">Telnet</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Telnet is widely used to provide remote command-based access to a variety of devices and is commonly used on network devices for remote administration. However, Telnet is a clear-text protocol and is vulnerable to various packet capture techniques.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that Telnet was enabled on retail.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker who was able to monitor network traffic could capture sensitive information or authentication credentials.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Network packet and password sniffing tools are widely available on the Internet and some of the tools are specifically designed to capture clear-text protocol authentication credentials. However, in a switched environment an attacker may not be able to capture network traffic destined for other devices without employing an attack such as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that, if possible, Telnet be disabled. If remote administrative access to the device is required, Nipper recommends that SSH be configured. The Telnet service can be disabled on individual lines with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">transport input none</div>&nbsp;<br>
The following Cisco IOS command can be used to disable Telnet on individual lines, but enable SSH:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">transport input ssh</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.9. <a name="sec_AccessControlLists">Access Control Lists</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Access Control List (ACL) are sequential lists of allow and deny Access Control Entries (ACE) that specify whether network traffic should be allowed or dropped. ACLs are used to restrict access to services and network devices, preventing access to services and devices that should not be accessible.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper identified thirteen security-related issues with the configured ACL, these are listed in Table 4.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<table class="table">
 <caption>Table 4: Insecure Access Control Entries</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>ACL</th>
   <th>Line</th>
   <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
 <tbody>
<tr><td>103</td><td><a href="#103-rule-1">1</a></td><td>Allows access from 200.1.1.1 to any destination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td><a href="#103-rule-2">2</a></td><td>Allows access from 200.1.1.1 to any destination.<br>Allows access from 200.1.1.1 to any destination service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td><a href="#103-rule-3">3</a></td><td>Allows access from 200.1.1.1 to any destination.<br>Allows access from 200.1.1.1 to any destination service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td><a href="#103-rule-4">4</a></td><td>Allows access from any source to any address.<br>Allows access from any address to any destination.<br>Allows access from any address to any destination service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td><a href="#103-rule-5">5</a></td><td>Does not log denied access.</td></tr>
<tr><td>105</td><td><a href="#105-rule-1">1</a></td><td>Allows access from a network source to 0.0.255.255 / .<br>Allows access from 10.1.1.0 / 0.0.0.255 to a network destination.<br>Allows access from 10.1.1.0 / 0.0.0.255 to any destination service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>105</td><td>N/A</td><td>ACL does not end with a deny all and log.</td></tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;<br>

<b>Impact:</b> If ACEs are not sufficiently restrictive, an attacker may be able to access services or network devices that should not be accessible. Furthermore, an attacker who had compromised a device could install a backdoor which could listen on a network port that was not filtered.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> N/A<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that the ACLs be reviewed and, where possible, modified to ensure that:<ul>
<li>ACE do not allow access from any source;</li>
<li>ACE do not allow access from entire source networks;</li>
<li>ACE do not allow access to any destination;</li>
<li>ACE do not allow access to entire destination networks;</li>
<li>ACE do not allow access to any destination port;</li>
<li>ACE log denied access;</li>
<li>ACL end with a deny all and log.</li>
</ul>
However, in certain circumstances, such as a public web server, a more relaxed configuration may be required to allow any host to access specific hosts and services.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.10. <a name="sec_Logging">Logging</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Logging is an essential component of a secure network configuration. Logging not only assists network administrators to identify issues when troubleshooting, but enables network administrators to react to intrusion attempts or Denial-of-Service attacks. It is therefore critical that logs be monitored, allowing administrators to take immediate action when an attack has been identified. Furthermore, system logs are a key component of a forensic investigation into past intrusions or service disruptions.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that logging had not been configured on retail.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker could attempt to map and bypass any configured ACL or to gain access to the Cisco Router without network administrators being alerted to the attempts. Furthermore, after an unauthorised intrusion into the network had been detected, it would be more difficult for an investigation to identify the source of the attack or the entry point without access to logs.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> N/A<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that Syslog and Buffered logging be configured on retail. Logging can be enabled with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">logging on</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
To configure Syslog logging, four things need to be set; a source interface for the Syslog messages to be sent from, one or more Syslog hosts to send messages to, the Syslog logging message severity level and the Syslog facility. The following commands can be used to configure Syslog logging:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">logging source-interface {<i>Interface</i>}</div>&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">logging host {<i>Syslog IP address or hostname</i>}</div>&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">logging trap {<i>Logging message severity level</i>}</div>&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">logging facility {<i>Syslog facility</i>}</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
Buffered logging can be configured with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">logging buffered {<i>Buffer Size</i>} {<i>Logging message severity level</i>}</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.11. <a name="sec_SSHProtocolVersion">SSH Protocol Version</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> The SSH service is commonly used for encrypted command-based remote device management. There are multiple SSH protocol versions and SSH servers will often support multiple versions to maintain backwards compatibility. Although flaws have been identified in implementations of version 2 of the SSH protocol, fundamental flaws exist in SSH protocol version 1.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that support for version 1 of the SSH protocol was supported on retail.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker who was able to intercept SSH protocol version 1 traffic would be able to perform a man-in-the-middle style attack. The attacker could then capture network traffic and possibly authentication credentials.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Although vulnerabilities are widely known, exploiting the vulnerabilities in the SSH protocol can be difficult.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that the SSH service be configured to support only version 2 of the SSH protocol. Version 2 of the SSH protocol can be configured with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">ip ssh version 2</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.12. <a name="sec_ClasslessRouting">Classless Routing</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Classless routing is enabled by default on Cisco routers. If a router has classless routing enabled and it receives a network packet for which there is no configured route, the router will forward the packet to the best destination. With classless routing disabled, the router would discard any network traffic for which no route is defined.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that classless routing was enabled on retail.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Network traffic that should not be routed by the router may be routed when classless routing is enabled.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> N/A<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that, if possible, classless routing be disabled. Classless routing can be disabled with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no ip classless</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.13. <a name="sec_MinimumPasswordLength">Minimum Password Length</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Cisco introduced an option from IOS version 12.3(1) which forces user, enable, secret and line passwords to meet a minimum length. This setting was introduced to help prevent the use of short passwords such as "cisco".<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that a minimum password length of six characters was configured.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> With a small minimum password length configured, it would be possible for a short password to be used. If an attacker were able to gain a password through dictionary-based guessing techniques or by a brute-force method, the attacker could gain a level of access to retail.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> A number of dictionary-based password guessing and password brute-force tools are available on the Internet.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that a minimum password length of at least eight characters be configured. The minimum password length can be configured with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">security passwords min-length {<i>length</i>}</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.14. <a name="sec_BOOTP">BOOTP</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> BOOTstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is a datagram protocol that allows compatible hosts to load their operating system over the network from a BOOTP server. Cisco routers are capable of acting as BOOTP servers for other Cisco devices and the service is enabled by default. However, BOOTP is rarely used and may represent a security risk.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that BOOTP was not disabled. However, it is worth noting that not all Cisco devices support BOOTP.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker could use the BOOTP service to download a copy of the router's IOS software.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Tools are available on the Internet to access BOOTP servers.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that, if not required, the BOOTP service be disabled. The following command can be used to disable BOOTP:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no ip bootp server</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.15. <a name="sec_EnableSecret">Enable Secret</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Cisco IOS-based device enable passwords can be stored using an iterated MD5 hash, which is far stronger than the easily reversible Cisco type-7 encryption.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper identified one enable password that was not stored using the MD5 hash.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker could use an enable password from a Cisco device to access the device and possibly modify its configuration.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> An attacker who had access to the Cisco configuration file would easily be able to retrieve passwords that are stored in clear-text or using the Cisco type-7 encryption. However, an attacker who had access to a Cisco configuration file could brute-force any stronger MD5 passwords.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that all enable passwords be stored using the MD5 hash. Enable passwords can be stored using the MD5 hash with the following Cisco IOS command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">enable secret</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.16. <a name="sec_ServicePasswordEncryption">Service Password Encryption</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Cisco service passwords are stored by default in their clear-text form rather than being encrypted. However, it is possible to have these passwords stored using the reversible Cisco type-7 encryption.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that the Cisco device retail was not running the password encryption service that helps provide a basic level of encryption to passwords that otherwise would be stored in clear-text.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> If a malicious user were to see a Cisco configuration that contained clear-text passwords, they could use the passwords to access the device. However, an attacker who had access to a Cisco configuration file would easily be able to reverse the passwords.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Even though it is trivial to reverse Cisco type-7 passwords, they do provide a greater level of security than clear-text passwords. Tools are widely available on the Internet that reverse Cisco type-7 passwords.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that the Cisco password encryption service be enabled. The Cisco password encryption service can be started with the following Cisco IOS command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">service password-encryption</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.17. <a name="sec_LoginBanner">Login Banner</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> A banner message can be shown to users who connect to one of the remote management services, such as Telnet. Typically banner messages will include information on the law with regard to unauthorised access to the device, warning users who do not have the authority to access the device about the consequences.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that no login banner was configured.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Attackers who have gained access to a device could avoid legal action if no banner is configured to warn against unauthorised access.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> N/A<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that a banner be configured that warns against unauthorised access. Banners are configured on Cisco devices using a delimiter character. A delimiter character is specified in the banner command and is used again to mark the end of the banner. The Cisco command to add a login banner, that is presented to users prior to authentication, is:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">banner login {<i>delimiter</i>} <i>The banner text</i> {<i>delimiter</i>}</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.18. <a name="sec_DomainLookups">Domain Lookups</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Cisco IOS-based devices support name lookups using the Domain Name System (DNS). However, if a DNS server has not been configured, then the DNS request is broadcast.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that name lookups had not been disabled and no DNS servers had been configured.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker who was able to capture network traffic could monitor DNS queries from the Cisco Router. Furthermore, Cisco devices can connect to Telnet servers by supplying only the hostname or IP address of the server. A mistyped Cisco command could be interpreted as an attempt to connect to a Telnet server and broadcast on the network.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> It would be trivial for an attacker to capture network traffic broadcast from a Cisco Router. Furthermore, network traffic capture tools are widely available on the Internet.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that domain lookups be disabled. Domain lookups can be disabled with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no ip domain-lookup</div>&nbsp;<br>
If domain lookups are required, Nipper recommends that DNS be configured. DNS can be configured with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">ip name-server {<i>IP address</i>}</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>

<h3>3.9. <a name="con_Routing">Routing</a></h3>
A network device's routing tables can be configured with static routes or updated dynamically. Routing protocols are used by network routing devices to dynamically update the routing tables that devices use to forward network traffic to their destination. Router protocols can be split into two different categories; Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) and Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs). IGPs are usually used in situations where the routing devices are all controlled by a single entity, such as within a company. EGPs are usually used in situations where routing devices are managed by a number of entities, such as the Internet. Typically routing devices support a number of standard routing protocols.<br>

<h3>3.10. <a name="con_Lines">Lines</a></h3>
The Cisco line configuration settings are used to configure administrative access to the device. The console line type is used for accessing the Cisco device directly through a cable attached to the device's console port. The auxiliary lines are used for remote access to the device, typically through attached modems. The Virtual Teletype (VTY) lines are used for access to the device through a remote access service such as SSH or Telnet.<br>

<h3>3.12. <a name="con_NAT">NAT</a></h3>
Network Address Translation (NAT) is used to map an IP address to an alternative IP address and is commonly used to map internal network IP addresses to Internet visible IP addresses. There are four different types of NAT on Cisco Router devices, dynamic NAT, static NAT, port static NAT and network static NAT. Static NAT translates one specific IP address into another specific IP address. Dynamic NAT translates an IP address into one of a pool of IP addresses. Port static NAT translates a specific IP address and port to another specific IP address and port. Finally, network static NAT translates a specific network subnet to another specific network subnet.<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<h3>3.13. <a name="con_AccessControlList">Access Control List</a></h3>
A Cisco ACL is a sequential list of apply or deny ACEs that a Cisco device will apply to network traffic. The Cisco device will check network traffic against the ACL and the first ACE match will determine whether the packet is accepted or rejected. If the Cisco device does not have an ACE that applies then the packet is denied. When a packet is rejected after access list processing, an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) host unreachable message is sent, unless it had been disabled.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
There are two different types of ACLs on IOS-based Cisco devices, standard and extended. Standard ACLs have an access list number between 1 and 99, extended ACLs are numbered 100 or above. Standard ACLs only define the source address and process the packet solely based on that. Extended ACLs contain additional checks, such as destination address and network port numbers.<br>
